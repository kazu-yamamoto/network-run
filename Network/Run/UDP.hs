-- | Running a UDP server with a connected socket in each Haskell thread.
--   The first request is given to the server.
--   Suppose that the server is serving on __addrS:portS__ and
--   a client connects to the service from __addrC:portC__.
--   A connected socket is created by binding to __*:portS__ and
--   connecting to __addrC:portC__,
--   resulting in __(UDP,addrS:portS,addrC:portC)__ where
--   __addrS__ is given magically.
--   This approach is fragile due to NAT rebidings.
